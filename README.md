ABSTRACT

ONeSAMP 3.0 computes the effective population size of gene data sets. The estimation of the genetic effective 
population size (Ne) has been an established challenge in the field of population genetics. In this program we use local linear regression and five 
summary statistics to conclude the Ne value. The software will take a file in GENEPOP format and provide the user with the effective population size.
